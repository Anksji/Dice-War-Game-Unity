## Introduction
Throw your dice and spawn your army and this army will fight with your opponent to capture his territory. This is a fun game developed in Unity 3d. I have also added some spawn multipliers at specified locations in each level, If your army passes those spawn areas then it will get multiplied with the multiplier value, this game is amazing to play.
